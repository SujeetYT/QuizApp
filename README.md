## Description
***
I want to make a Quiz Playing Web Application in which people can practice the questions and feel the pressure due to time limitation.

People can have different options like 
- 1 minutes/Question.
- 60 minutes/ 60 Questions

### Walkthrough 
---
- User will enter his/her name
- User will have to select the Subject for the quiz test
- User will have to choose the time boundation either:

    1.  1 minutes/Question.
    2.  60 minutes/ 60 Questions

Now user can start the Quiz test and the get the score according to the number of the questions

4 marks for every correct answer
-1 marks for every incorrect answer
